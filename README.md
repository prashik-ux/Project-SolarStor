# ☀️ SolarStor: Energy Storage Optimization for Solar-Powered Batteries

Modeling, Simulation, and Performance Analysis of Integrated Solar Battery Systems

## 🧠 Overview
SolarStor is a research-driven project focused on optimizing energy storage in solar-powered battery systems through computational modeling, data analysis, and simulation techniques. The project investigates how battery technologies—such as lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and emerging chemistries—can be effectively integrated into photovoltaic (PV) systems to provide reliable, cost-efficient, and sustainable energy solutions.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Simulate solar energy generation and storage performance under varying environmental and load conditions

* Analyze battery efficiency, charge/discharge cycles, and degradation in real-world solar use cases

* Evaluate different battery chemistries (Li-ion, Na-ion, LFP, etc.) for compatibility with solar PV

* Optimize energy management strategies and storage configurations for grid-tied and off-grid systems

* Provide design recommendations for scalable and cost-effective solar energy storage solutions

## 🔍 Key Features

* 🔆 Solar PV generation modeling using real irradiance and temperature datasets

* 🔋 Battery performance modeling based on charge rate, capacity fade, thermal behavior

* ⚡ System simulation with load profiles, inverter behavior, and storage sizing

* 📈 Dashboard for analytics using Python & Jupyter (Matplotlib, Plotly, pandas)

* 🌐 Open-access data compatibility (NREL, PVWatts, NASA POWER)

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
